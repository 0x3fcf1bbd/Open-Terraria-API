##Downloads
This section contains the dump of our bin directories which are typically updated each time a developer commits to the repository. While most of the time these binaries should work outright, they are still development files and serve as the Bleeding Edge files over at [https://openterraria.com/bleeding-edge](https://openterraria.com/bleeding-edge).
These files can be used to create a minimalistic server that replicates the functionality of the official Re-Logic server. Additionally you can download the TDSM Rebind or TShock 5 (Orion) modifications.


Below is a basic directory structure of some of the required files.

### Example Directory Structure:
```
\Binaries\
  OTA.dll
  TerrariaServer.exe
  TerrariaServer.exe.config	
\Binaries\Plugins\
  ** Here you can use TDSM Rebind or TShock 5 (Orion)
\Binaries\Libraries\
  ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib.dll
  KopiLua.dll
  Mono.Nat.dll
  Newtonsoft.Json.dll
  NLua.dll

# Open Terraria API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DeathCradle/Open-Terraria-API.svg?branch=MonoMod)](https://travis-ci.org/DeathCradle/Open-Terraria-API?branch=MonoMod)

The Open Terraria API, known as OTAPI, is a unique low-level API for [Terraria](https://terraria.org) that exposes events and provides performance optimisations while supporting both client and server executables on all official platforms.

You can use this modification as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OTAPI/) to power your own project with minimal update downtime*, or you can build plugins for [Pryaxis's TShock](https://github.com/Pryaxis/TShock) which uses OTAPI under the hood.

OTAPI v3 is now developed using .NET Core and is based on MonoMod which means you can now use Runtime or Patchtime modifications. Further details will follow as development continues.

# Open Terraria API

Open Terraria API is a Terraria modification that exposes hooks from within both the client and server executables.

Unlike the main branch this version will be shipped on NuGet using an OTAPI.dll which contains both the Terraria & OTAPI assemblies. This provides more flexibility for external projects who wish to run their application as the host.

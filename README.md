*Supporting Terraria v1.3!*  

The Open Terraria API is a modification of the official dedicated Terraria server software.

In this API it contains the tools to run a cross platform vanilla server with plugin support. Plugins written using .NET as well as LUA can tap into and use the extended functionalities such as:
 1. OWIN based web server
 2. Logging system
 3. Server,Player,NPC and World events
 4. Permissions system for player restrictions and privileges
 5. Data API when using a connector. Thus allowing a plugin to quickly store server side character data in a SQL database.

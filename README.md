# Open Terraria API

The Open Terraria API, known as OTAPI, is a unique low-level API for Terraria that exposes events and provides performance optimisations.

You can use this modification as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OTAPI/) to power your own project with minimal update downtime*, or you can build plugins for [NyxStudio's Orion](https://github.com/NyxStudios/Orion) which uses OTAPI under the hood.
